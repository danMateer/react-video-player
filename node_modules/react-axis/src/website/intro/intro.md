# React Axis

An axis widget intended to replace generated D3 SVG with a React friendly component that supports timezones correctly.

Under the hood, it uses:
    * d3.scale and d3.format
    * moment.js and moment-timezone

SVG rendering is done with React.

This is a basic version of the functionality needed for a full charting application, but it's a start. It currently supports:

 * A general purpose `Axis` component
     - Supports log, power and linear scales
     - Supports animation between scales
     - Can be positioned in different ways

 * A more specific `TimeAxis` component
     - Supports arbitrary timezones
     - Supports animations between scales
     - Flexible support for tick formatting

We will be making use of this project in [react-timeseries-charts](http://software.es.net/react-timeseries-charts). Once that happens we'll bump this to v1.0.

Getting started
---------------

This React Axis component is intended to be installed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and the built into your project with a tool like [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). As it is a standalone axis component, most likely it should be used in another library, but who knows. Either way, it expects React to be present.

To install:

    npm install react-axis --save

You can then import and use either the Axis or TimeAxis. In general the component is designed to be rendered within existing SVG (though it has a stand alone mode too):

```js
    import { TimeAxis } from "react-axis";
```

```js
    render() {
        ...
        return (
            <svg>
                ...
                <TimeAxis
                    timezone="America/Chicago"
                    position="bottom"
                    beginTime={beginTime}
                    endTime={endTime}
                    width={800} height={50}
                />
            </svg>
        );
    }
```

Developing
----------

The repo contains the examples/ website. This is very helpful in developing new functionality. Within a cloned repo, you first need to run:

    yarn install

This will install the development dependencies into your node_modules/ directory.

You can then start up the test server, as well as automatic source building, by doing:

    yarn run start-website
